# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)
The style I may add in the future is adding better backgrounds and dropdown lists of recipes for the project. I may add simple life improvements for better convenience in using the website with more categories.
